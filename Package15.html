                  <p>A total day trip of Trincomalee, covering all main tourist attractions and places to see in this lively and traditional city, such as Pigeon Island, Fort Frederick, Trincomalee Harbour and more.<br> The trip will start at 6am with a dolphin watching excursion. A boat ride offshore the coast of Trincomalee to the deep waters which would take approximately 30 minutes, will enable you to see a majority of dolphins popping up above the water. In our experience whales appear only for a short period on the east coast which is from March to May, however you may be lucky to spot a whale during the off season months. Upon completion of the dolphin watching excursion, the boat will take you to Pigeon Island. Pigeon Island is one of Sri Lanka’s two maritime national parks. It consists of amazing coral reefs surrounded by extraordinary and diverse species of tropical fish and other aquatic life such as turtles. For those who would like to experience snorkelling, there is an optional excursion.<br> Climb the rock formations on the other side of the island and see beautiful panoramas of the sea. <br><br>You will be served breakfast in picnic style on the island. After breakfast, you will return to the mainland and proceed to Fort Frederick. Explore the fort where it houses the famous Konaswaram Temple situated on a high cliff known as Swami Rock, facing the Bay of Bengal and the eastern coast of India which is a magnificent view. You can see other temples located within the fort.<br><br> Stop for a local lunch.<br><br> After lunch, the trip will reconvene by visiting Trincomalee’s pride, its natural harbour spreading over hectares of water and land. It comprises of three bays which are Back Bay, Dutch Bay and inner harbour. Stroll along the banks of the harbour and enjoy its surroundings with cafes and restaurants.<br><br> Next visit is Marble Beach, the most beautiful and unspoilt beaches in the Trincomalee area. It is managed by the Sri Lanka Air Force; therefore it is a secure area with shallow waters ideal for swimming. Enjoy a stroll along the beach and see the marble pebbles that can be found.<br><br> Return back to your destination.</p>

                <p>A total day trip covering all top spots to see and major insights of the vibrant emerging city of Jaffna such as Nallur Kovil, Jaffna Fort, Point Pedro and much more.<br>We would collect you from your hotel in Jaffna with a packed breakfast to reach Nallur Kovil by 7am. Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil, one of Jaffna’s iconic landmarks is an exemplar piece of Jaffna’s history. Its distinct red and white stripes on its exterior walls are a clear symbol of Hinduism, thereby reflecting great cultural and social significance to the identity of the Hindu Tamils of North Sri Lanka. After exploring Nallur Kovil, we will proceed to Jaffna Archaeological Museum. This museum houses many collections from the Buddhist and Hindu religions, in various forms of metal, wood and stone. The collections range from the ancient era to the colonial era. It has some of the archaeological excavation findings of Kandarodai.<br>The Jaffna Public Library would be the next place of visit. The second main public library of Sri Lanka and distinct landmark of Jaffna, it is a striking piece of British colonial architecture. Having been destroyed by a fire during the civil war, the library was rehabilitated and rebuilt, now considered an important Tamil cultural centre and historic institution.<br>Proceed to see the glorious and serene Jaffna Fort, a symbol of colonial history. Overlooking the lagoon with colourful fishing boats, the fort offers stellar views of sunsets and has a quiet atmosphere of its own. Stroll through the fort and observe its unique features.<br>Have an early lunch at a typical local restaurant serving authentic Jaffna style food.<br> After lunch, drive to Point Pedro, passing through Jaffna town, observing sights and sounds of daily life in Jaffna, embracing unique vibes of Hindu culture which is significant of the North. Point Pedro sits at the northernmost tip of the island, facing the Bay of Bengal, marked by a painted flag of Sri Lanka sitting proud on the edge of a coral rock. Discover the northern coastline of Sri Lanka, the lighthouse sits on the west side of the shore and if its a clear day, you may see the southern coastline of India. Drive from here to Keerimalai Springs. A natural spring that has been built into a bathing pool with its wall separating the spring from the sea. Enjoy a dip into the spring with a beautiful view of the sea.<br> Return back to hotel.</p>

This moonstone is considered one of the best and most preserved arts from this era dating back to the 7th-8th centuries. Then you can see the Guardstone. The Rathna Prasada was once the largest building in the Abhayagiriyi monastery which was destroyed during the South Indian invasions.

                <p>Ella is a cozy calm mountain village, hidden away in the southern edge of the charming Central highlands in the Badulla District of Uva Province, Sri Lanka. An ideal getaway from the hustle and bustle lifestyle of big cities, this lovely little village is highly sought-after by adventurers and those seeking a peaceful setting to revel in the wonders of nature.<br><br>Ella is perched at an altitude of 1,041 meters amidst lush green pine forests. The village is a go-to hub for backpackers across the globe, with the magnificent Ella Rock and Little Adam’s Peak being among the most popular hiking destinations, as the treks venture through plantations and wilderness with stunning views along the way. The name ´Ella´ appropriately derives from the Sinhalese term for ´waterfall´, seeing as the village has multiple sublime cascades in its vicinity. Dunhinda Falls, Diyaluma Falls and Ravana Falls are few such waterfalls. Located behind Ravana Falls is the The Ravana Cave, linked to King Ravana of the legendary Ramayana epic, where it is said the Demon King abducted Princess Sita in India and concealed her here.<br><br>Demodara Loop, known to be a marvel in railway engineering and the Nine Arches Bridge, also referred to as the Bridge in the Sky, are also prominent tourist attractions in Ella due to the architectural innovation and picturesque foliage surrounding both. The Dhowa Rock Temple and Cave located near Ella was declared an archaeological protected monument in Sri Lanka in 1996. Located 137 kilometers away from Kandy and 204 kilometers to the East of Colombo, the village is encompassed by magnificent mountains, cloud forests, vegetation and boundless tea plantations, and is also home to a rich biodiversity. The train ride to Ella, through the clouds and hills of Sri Lanka, is listed among the most beautiful and scenic train journeys in the world.<br><br>

The cave resides behind the waterfall, Ravana Falls (Ravana Ella), considered one of the widest in Sri Lanka, especially during the rainy season.<br><br>Ella Rock – The scenic hike to the majestic summit of the Ella Rock is most popular among backpackers. It is approximately a 10 kilometer (round trip) hike across the woodlands of Ella, which present magnificent views such as the Ella Gap Waterfall, and the Ella Gap; a space between the mountains that reveal a spectacular view that stretches all the way to the Southern Coast of the isle.<br><br>Little Adam’s Peak (Punchi Sri Pada) – Named so due to its striking similarity to the sacred mountain Adam’s Peak (Sri Pada), Little Adam´s Peak, also known as Mini Adam´s Peak, is another popular hiking destination in the vicinity. The 1,141 meter peak is a relatively less demanding hike than that of Ella Rock.<br><br>The Demodare Nine Arches Bridge – Also known as the Bridge in the Sky, the Nine Arches Bridge in Demodare is a unique 30 meter high viaduct, constructed amidst picturesque foliage of the central hills, using solely cement and stone bricks. Its architectural brilliance and the railway track with its breathtaking panoramic surroundings has made it a favorite among tourists.´
                  <br><br>The Demodare Loop – Demodare tube and railway entrance known as the Demodare Loop, is where the rail route travels around a spiral loop beneath itself and emerges out of a tunnel situated exactly underneath the Demodare train station. This railway engineering wonder is the only spiral loop in the world where a tunnel lies under a railway station.<br><br>Diyaluma Excursion – The second tallest waterfall in Sri Lanka, Diyaluma Falls is at an incredible height of 220 meters. The Diyaluma Excursion can be divided into two. Lower Diyaluma Falls is much easier to access as it is located close to Koslanda, on the side of the Colombo – Badulla highway. However, the Upper Diyaluma Trek is a glory to behold, with several natural pools nestled atop the 220 meter waterfall.<br><br>Ella Spice Garden – Located amidst a tea estate, this private garden is home to an assortment of Sri Lankan spices cultivated by a local household. Ella Spice Garden provides an exemplary culinary experience of the extensive range of the complex local cuisines in Sri Lanka, popularly known as ´rice and curry´.<br><br>Dhowa Rock Temple and Cave – Declared a protected heritage site and an archaeological protected monument in Sri Lanka in 1996, Dhowa Temple is famed for its incomplete 38 ft Buddha Statue, carved out of a granite boulder. The temple is amalgamated with the cave that is adorned with vibrant and striking murals depicting Jataka stories. It is believed to have been constructed by King Walagamba in the first century BC, when he took refuge in the Uva Province, following Indian invasions.<br><br>Lipton´s Seat – With one of the most impressive and panoramic viewpoints, it is named so after Sir Thomas Lipton, the renown Scottish aristocrat and tea planter. He used to observe his flourishing tea empire from this point, from which a magnificent view unfolds at your feet, displaying the 7 provinces, Hambanthota Harbour in the Southern coast and many other notable points.
                <br><br>Dunhinda River – Renowned as one of the most beautiful waterfalls, the 64 meter drop is also called Bridal River due to the form of the drop resembling that of a Bridal veil.<br><br>Bambarakanda Ella River – The Tallest waterfall in Sri Lanka cascading from a lush cliff falling 240 metres from Horton Plains into the Valawe River.<br><br>Ella Market on Wednesdays – On Wednesday mornings, Ella has a charming little market down Passara Road (Ella Superstore).

                <p>Travel your path through the thick, lush forest that is teeming with an immense variety of wildlife – native plants and animals across an area of 18,900 acres of land.<br><br>Situated on the south-west lowland that falls into the Sabaragamuwa and southern provinces, it is 171.9 km away from Colombo via the southern expressway, roughly a 4 hour drive. This is one of the main rainforests that’s known due to the fact that it a habitat for 50% of the country’s native species of animals including the mammals, reptiles, insects as well as rare amphibians. It is a haven for the nature enthusiasts out there – there’s still so much to discover in their point of view.<br><br>Immersed in legend, this rainforest attained its name from Lion (Sinha) King (Raja) since it was a legendary belief that the origins of the Sinhala people is from the union between a princess and the lion king who once lived in the forest.<br><br>Nature lovers from all over the globe visit the forest for another important reason; it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. The forest was designated as a biosphere reserve in 1978. It is a highly protected area because it is currently the last virgin rainforest that’s relatively undisturbed by urban development and the modern era, and measures must be taken to keep it the way it is – untouched in its own magical way.
                <br><br>A lot of awareness is being held for the conservation of the forest, and one of the priorities is that the number of visitors allowed into the forest is very low, only by permit that needs to be obtained. This is a completely justifiable approach because if a steady amount of people were to be allowed in the natural beauty of the entire forest would be stripped away.
                <br><br>Bird watching in Sinharaja – One of the main highlights in the forest is the variety of birds that can be seen, there are over 270 types that have been identified which are all extraordinary and special. Therefore it is a bird paradise for all bird watching lovers.<br><br>Trekking in Sinharaja – Trekking through Sinharaja would entail many different paths such as the Mulawella Peak and Singhala Peak Trails. Others are for bird watching, butterfly observation and within the Arboretum.<br><br>Kolawenigama Temple – The temple is located 3 km away from Deniyaya, and it resembles Kandy’s famous temple of the sacred tooth relic. It was built by King Buwanekabahu VII due to the efforts taken by the villagers to protect the tooth relic. <br><br>Kiruwananaganga Falls – Undoubtedly one of the most striking in the country with picture white mist surrounding it, this impressive waterfall is 60 meters high and up to 60 meters wide during the rainy season. <br><br>Getabaruwa Raja Maha Viharaya – Placed in a very scenic environment, the Getabaruwa Raja Maha Viharaya is located between the Rakwana, Morawaka and the Sinharaja mountain ranges. Well known for the large statue of Lord Buddha sleeping with a statue of Mugalan Thero at his feet and a statue of Sariuth Thera at the side of his head.
                <br><br>Day Trip to Sinharaja Forest – A day trip to the Sinharaja Forest from your destination, in which you would cover attractions of the forest and participate in various trekking and nature trails encountering many species for bird and wildlife.</p>

                <p>As a old capital second only to Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa is known for its well-kept remains reflecting Sri Lanka’s olden times, going back to the Anuradhapuran era making it one of the most cultural spots. The city gained its fame as an important local trading center replacing Anuradhapura which was destroyed and left for ruin. The golden medieval era during the 11th to 13th centuries was magnificent and successful though brief, announced the grandeur of Sinhalese kingdoms and widespread Buddhist civilization.<br><br>The beauty of that era can be found in the monumental treasures that stand on the east shore of a large artificial lake, the Parakrama Samudraya, a notable landmark of Polonnaruwa which was built by King Parakramabahu I during his reign in the golden age of Polonnaruwa. You can find remains of a palace, a huge stupa, beautiful striking statues and an unusually built structure which is beyond explanation.<br><br>At the south end of the lake, there is a standing statue of King Parakramabahu carved out of rock. Another set of impressive remains are the sculptures at the Gal Vihara. These sculptures were cut into granite stone during the middle of the 12th century. The whole carving is made of four enormous statues of Buddha in different positions.<br><br>All of these remains can be seen in the city.<br><br>
                Parakrama Sea – Known as a guardian of Buddhism and for the progress of irrigation, King Parakramabahu’s greatest achievement was the construction of a reservoir which covers over 2400 hectares. It was named Parakrama Sea, which means Sea of Parakrama since it is huge in size. <br><br>Royal Palace – King Parakramabahu’s grand palace was a massive structure although nothing remains of its seven stories today but the massive walls show the areas which had the floor beams for at least two more floors.<br><br>
                Audience Hall – The Assembly Hall was located near the Regal Mansion. The large hall has detailed carvings that have intricate elephant friezes and columns with each elephant posing in various ways. Impressive sculptures of guardian lions sit atop of the steps with their paws touching an ancient inscription. The great king held council meetings with his ministers in this hall.<br><br>Royal Bathing Pool – In the corner of the palace grounds, you will find this swimming pool. The water flowed through stone channels and then through a dragon’s mouth into the pond. At one end, there lies a stone chamber but in the center of the pond there is a huge stone lotus with brilliant fierce lions at the corners.
                <br><br>The Quadrangle – The centerpiece of the ancient city refers to the Square also known as Dalada Maluwa, which is a sacred complex comprising the ruins of Polonnaruwa’s incredible buildings, such as the circular house of the Polonnaruwa Vatadage which is famous for its splendid carvings; the well-preserved image house of Thuparamaya which depicts the best example of a gedige reflecting Sinhalese architecture; the exquisite carved columns resembling lotus buds atop of spiral stalks with a stone latticed fence of the new architectural styled building of Latha Mandapaya (Floral Altar); Atadage, the first Temple of the Tooth; the relic house of Hatadage is similar to the Atadage in design, concept and purpose; an enormous book carved out of rock called Gal Potha, Stone Book which has inscriptions of the deeds of King Nissanka Malla; an unusual oriental styled building of seven stories, the Satmahal Prasadaya; and in the south of the Square there is a Shiva Devale built with Hindu traditions.<br><br>
                Rankoth Vehera – The 4th largest dagoba in the country and was constructed by King Nissanka Malla to follow the tradition of early stupas built in Anuradhapura. There are image houses and flower altars that surround the dagoba.<br><br>Pabalu Vehera – This stupa, Pabalu Vehera was constructed by Rupavati, one of the queens of Parakramabahu I according to historical chronicles. Its original name is still unknown but the present name; Pabalu (meaning, beads) was given because a large number of small glass beads were found during the excavations in the vicinity of the monastic complex.<br><br>Lankatilaka – The soaring walls of this image house reaches 16 metres high and there is a huge headless Buddha image and superb murals within this still impressive structure.<br><br>Kiri Vihara (Milk-white Vihara) – This milk-white shrine is the best preserved dagoba in Polonnaruwa. The building was found unscathed when the jungle was cleared away even after it was constructed 700 years ago. The dagoba was named Kiri Vihara due to its gleaming white exterior and it was constructed by Queen Kalinga Subhadra Mahadevi who was a consort of King Parakramabahu <br><br>Gal Vihara – North of the Alahana Pirivena Complex are the ruins of another monastic complex, the Uttararama Monastery. Part of this collection is the Gal Vihara with its world renowned statues. There are four figures of the Buddha carved out of a small cliff face of granite, which are considered to be the best rock sculptures in the island.<br><br>Nelum Pokuna – Nelum Pokuna, the Lotus Pond is a beautifully carved granite pond that was constructed into the shape of a Lotus flower. There are 7 ponds altogether with the main pond. It has five levels with eight petals. 
                <br><br>Tivanka Image House – This building constructed with brick has an extraordinary image of Lord Buddha posing in three different angles. There are vivid and colourful murals and paintings; some are with lions and dwarves.</p>
